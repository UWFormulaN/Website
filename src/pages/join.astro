      <p>
        The molecules we work with, known as molecular machines, can replicate
        basic functions typically observed on a larger scale, such as switches
        and rotors. Unlike their macroscopic counterparts that rely on
        electricity or motors, these molecular systems respond to subtle
        environmental changes and thermal fluctuations.

        In 2016, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognized the "design and
        synthesis of molecular machines‚Äù and showcased one of the first
        nanocars. Further work on these machines by top universities around the
        world has been showcased in the two International Nanocar Races in 2017
        and 2022.
