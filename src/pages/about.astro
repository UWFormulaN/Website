      <p>
        Formula Nano began as the passion project of a group of ambitious, naive
        and rather excited students. We were captivated by the concept of
        nanocars and molecular machines—and by their charming simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are over two dozen student design teams at the University of
        Waterloo, but little representation for nanotechnology engineering.
        Given the field’s growing importance, we knew that had to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started the team as a way for students like us to gain experience,
        both technical and leadership. The strength of the University of
        Waterloo lies not only in its academics and co-op program but also in
        the innovation fostered through supporting student projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we have over 50 members, connections with the Waterloo Institute of
        Nanotechnology, and advisors from the Faculty of Engineering. Since we
        began, we have grown significantly from just reading research papers,
        and we hope to keep growing. We have big ambitions: we aim to compete in
        the next International Nanocar Race as both the first Canadian and the
        first undergraduate-led team.
