## Position Overview

Join our Instrumentation team to help build and refine our custom Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). This role is ideal for students passionate about electronics, physics and hands-on hardware development. You'll gain experience at the intersection of electrical engineering and surface science, and your work will contribute directly to our teams goal: high-resolution imaging and manipulation of our nanocar.

## Key Responsibilities

- Assist in STM hardware assembly and calibration
- Develop and test electronic control systems for ultra-sensitive current detection
- Designing and assembling circuits for piezoelectric positioning and feedback control
- Assisting in the mechanical design and vibration isolation of the STM housing
- Integrating software (LabVIEW or similar) to control scanning and data acquisition

## What You'll Learn

- Advanced microscopy techniques and principles
- Design and troubleshooting of sensitive signal processing
- Instrumentation control software development
- Research-grade measurement techniques
